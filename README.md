# Git & Github Tutorial for Beginners
I made this repository while following "Complete Git and GitHub Tutorial for Beginners"  by Apna College Youtube Channel. 
This is my introduction to the world of Git and GitHub. 
I wanted to learn them as I need to save all my coding files on GitHub and not on PC/Onedrive which I learnt on a forum.
Whenever I am starting a course/project, I need to first make a repository (private) and then pull to my local machine in the C:\User\Coding Workspace.
That way, my coding files stay safe on github as well as on PC without being backed up again in OneDrive.
This is the way things should be fron now on.
